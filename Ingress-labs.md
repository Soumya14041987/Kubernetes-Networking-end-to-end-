# To get started, add the Cert-manager repo on helm in your terminal. Use the following artifactory link to get the instructions.

https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager?modal=install

Ans :- helm repo add cert-manager https://charts.jetstack.io

# Create a namespace called cert-manager for Cert-manager.
 k create ns cert-manager

# Install Cert-manager in the newly created cert-manager namespace using Helm, including all necessary Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true

** Plaese note that installCRD flag is depreacted ,so use crds.enabled instead .

# Create an initial staging Issuer resource named letsencrypt-staging in the website namespace. Use the Staging server URL: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory.

#  Our Ingress has now been updated with Cert-manager, and a certificate has been created as a secret. We can also check the status of our certificate by describing the Certificate custom resource      
              
kubectl describe certificate -n website


# If the certificate was successfully created, proceed to create a new Production Issuer. Create a production Issuer resource named letsencrypt-production in the website namespace.

Now that we have a tested staging and a have an production issuer, update the Ingress website-ingress to use the production issuer for the domain companyx-website.com.
Ensure to add the necessary annotations.

kubectl annotate ingress -n website website-ingress cert-manager.io/issuer=letsencrypt-production --overwrite
